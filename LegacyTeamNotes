Notes from Sinusoudal Squirrel on this project:

Bryan:
Index.html loads all backbone files.
App.js - initiates AppModel, Stocks (its collection), AppView ({model: app, collection: stocks}).
          Setup router.on and renders appropriate pages

AppView -
  // initiates top-level views
  - this.formView = new FormView({collection: this.collection});
  - this.dashboardView = new DashboardView({collection: this.collection});
  - this.aboutusView = new AboutUsView();
  - this.signupView = new SignupView({model: this.model});
  - this.signinView = new SigninView({model: this.model});
  - this.render();
  - SignupView({model: this.model});
  - Signin, signup, aboutus views are routed by app.js

- FormView
  - displays input forms

- DashboardView -
  - this.graphView = new GraphView({collection: this.collection});
  - this.infoView = new InfoView({collection: this.collection});
